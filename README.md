## Overview  

This project loads and analyzes financial datasets, performs headline sentiment analysis, and generates insights into stock trends. Key features include:  
- Data preprocessing of stock and news data  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Sentiment analysis of headlines  
- Time series analysis for articles  
- Quantitative analysis for stock trends

## Key Analyses  

### **1. Data Loading and Preparation**  
- Load libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.  
- Process financial news data from a CSV file and stock price data.  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Calculate headline lengths and descriptive statistics.  
- Analyze article frequency per month, year, and specific high-activity days.  
- Identify March 12, 2020, as having the **highest article frequency**.  

### **3. Text Analysis**  
- Perform sentiment analysis to categorize headlines as positive, negative, or neutral.  
- Identify common bigrams in headlines, such as *"52 week"* and *"stocks moving"*.  
- Insights focus on market movements, analyst actions, and earnings updates.  

### **4. Time Series Analysis**  
- Plot time series data of article counts.  
- Analyze article publication times, showing peaks during early hours of the day.  

### **5. Publisher Analysis**  
- Analyze sentiment by publishers.  
- Identify the most frequent publisher, such as **benzinga.com**.  

### **6. Quantitative Analysis**  
- Load historical stock price data.  
- Calculate moving averages (SMA, EMA) to analyze trends.  
- Plot stock trends to visualize price movements.
